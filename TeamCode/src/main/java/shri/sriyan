"Icarus Laughed"

Here's what they don't tell you.
Icarus laughed as he
fell, threw his head back and yelled into the wind's arms,
spread wide teeth bade to the world.
There is a bitter triumph in crashing.
When you, you should be soaring.
The wax scorched.
His skin ran blazing trails down his back, his thighs, his
ankles, his feet feathers floated like prayers
past his fingers is close enough to snatch back.
Death breathed burning kisses against his
shoulders, where the wings joined the harness.
The sun painted everything in shades of gold.
There is a certain beauty in setting the
world on fire and watching from the center of the flames.
